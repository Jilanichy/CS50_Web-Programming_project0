        <h2 class="title1">Why traveling is so important for our life?</h2><br>
        <div>
            <p class="para1">Yes, traveling is like a book, read the first page and then move to the next. What I mean is, leave your hometown and experience a new place by visiting there, then only you will move to the next page/phase of life. Going to a new page is the continuation of your journey, it means you are not stopped in life, you are moving and learning. Traveling lets you make new Friends forever. It starts with Sharing and Caring each other. If you haven’t met anyone or someone like you, then you have to go far away for that person. Friends gonna help you to learn new things and adopt new styles.</p>
            <p>Traveling lets you make new Friends forever. It starts with Sharing and Caring each other. If you haven’t met anyone or someone like you, then you have to go far away for that person. Friends gonna help you to learn new things and adopt new styles. Giving yourself time in a day is fruitful, and giving few days in the year will make you motivated and energized throughout the year. Refresh your mind and body and enjoy and place your phones, tablets, and laptops away from you. There is something therapeutic about being alone and being at  peace with it. While you soak in a new culture, you also connect with  your own inner self. </p>

        <h2 class="title2">How to prepare for traveling?</h2><br>

        <div>
            <p class="para2">Prepare for the worst. The journey will become memories when you face new challenges, do some outing, adventure, skiing, sky dive, bungee jumping, underwater diving, river rafting or bonfire. New challenges will become good memories. Take new steps, and enjoy your journey to the uphills, chilled areas, long rides, and much more. A journey always makes you inspired and motivate you to do some creativity. Take a trip or go on a tour once in a month or two. You look energized, active, happy, strong, and confident. You’ll be more manageable and focused, yes, it’s natural.</p>
